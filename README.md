    'Wed' => 9..17,
    'Thu' => 9..17,
    'Fri' => 9..17,
    'Sat' => 9..13
  }
)

calendar.working_days_between(Date.new(2019, 8, 1), Date.new(2019, 8, 5))
# => 3.5

calendar.add_working_days(Date.new(2019, 8, 3), 1)
# => Date.new(2019, 8, 5)

calendar.add_working_days(Time.new(2019, 8, 3, 9, 0), 1)
# => Time.new(2019, 8, 5, 13, 0)

calendar.working_hours_between(Time.new(2019, 8, 2, 8, 0), Time.new(2019, 8, 3, 14, 0))
# => 12

calendar.roll_forward(Time.new(2019, 8, 4))
# => Time.new(2019, 8, 5, 9, 0)
```

)

calendar.working_days_between(Date.new(2019, 12, 24), Date.new(2019, 12, 26))
# => 2.0
```
